# Block Share - File Sharing System

Block Share is a decentralized file sharing system that has been developed in three phases to enhance functionality and reliability.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Implementation
In the initial phase, we created the project using fundamental web technologies:
- HTML for structuring the content
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for interactive features



### Phase 2: React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, and REST API Integration
In the second phase, we elevated the project by incorporating modern technologies and frameworks:
- React.js for building a dynamic user interface
- Node.js and Express.js for server-side development
- MongoDB as the database for efficient data storage
- Integration of REST APIs to enhance communication between client and server

### Phase 3: Decentralization with Web3.Storage and IPFS
The third and final phase involved transforming the project into a decentralized file-sharing system:
**Built with Passion, Powered by Technology:**
- React.js: Crafted a fluid and user-friendly interface.
- MUI (Material-UI): Added a touch of elegance with beautiful UI components.
- Redux Toolkit Query: Ensured seamless data fetching and management.
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): Decentralized storage for a tamper-proof future.
- Web3.Storage: Blockchain-powered security for your valuable files.

By leveraging Web3.Storage, we achieved a decentralized architecture that enhances security and reliability in file storage.
